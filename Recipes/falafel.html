		<h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Baking Soda</li>
			<li>Oil for Frying</li>
			<li>Chickpeas</li>
			<li>Onion</li>
			<li>Parsley</li>
			<li>Cilantro</li>
			<li>Garlic</li>
			<li>Green Chile Pepper</li>
			<li>Cumin, Cardamom, Salt and Black Pepper</li>
			<li>Chickpea Flour</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Soak your dried chickpeas: Overnight or for at least 8-12 hours.
				Note that the chickpeas will triple in size, so cover them with
				plenty of water. Then drain and rinse them.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add all the ingredients to a food processor: Add the chickpeas,
				onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic, green pepper and spices to a
				food processor. I recommend roughly chopping up the onion, herbs
				and pepper before adding. Pulse the food processor but do not
				blend completely. The final mixture should resemble coarse sand.
			</li>

			<li>
				Transfer the mixture to a bowl: Then add the chickpea flour and
				baking soda, stir it together until it's fully combined and
				cover with plastic wrap or a lid.
			</li>

			<li>
				Place the bowl in the fridge: Chill the falafel mixture for 30
				minutes to 1 hour.
			</li>

			<li>
				Shape your falafel: You can do this by hand, with a cookie scoop
				(which is what I use) or a falafel scoop. Decide if you'd like
				round balls or flatter patty shapes. The flatter shapes are
				better if you plan to pan fry or bake. Any shape can be used for
				deep frying. Form all your falafel and place on a plate.
			</li>
		</ol>
