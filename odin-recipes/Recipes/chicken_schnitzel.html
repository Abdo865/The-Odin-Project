		<h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				4 4-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded to
				1/8-inch thickness
			</li>

			<li>
				2 cups (or more) whole wheat (or regular) panko (Japanese
				breadcrumbs)
			</li>

			<li>1 cup all-purpose flour (for dredging)</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
			<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>Chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
			<li>Lemon wedges</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Season chicken breasts
				with salt and pepper. Place flour on a plate. Beat eggs and
				Dijon mustard to blend in a shallow bowl or baking dish. Place 1
				cup panko in another shallow bowl or baking dish, adding
				remaining 1 cup panko, or more, to dish as needed throughout
				process. Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dredge in
				flour, shaking off excess, then dip into egg mixture, turning to
				coat evenly; carefully coat with panko, pressing panko gently to
				adhere to chicken. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet.
			</li>

			<li>
				Heat 1 Tbsp. oil and 1 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over
				medium-high heat (pan should be large enough to hold 2 breasts).
				Add 2 chicken breasts to skillet and cook until golden brown on
				both sides, 8-10 minutes. Transfer chicken breasts to a paper
				towel-lined plate and season with salt. Add remaining 1 Tbsp.
				oil and 1 Tbsp. butter to skillet and repeat with remaining
				chicken breasts. Transfer chicken breasts to plates and garnish
				each with parsley and a lemon wedge.
			</li>
		</ol>
